The application that automates vocabulary learning by converting books and videos into interactive flashcards.
Our project aims to revolutionize the way people learn foreign languages from books and videos. Traditionally, readers underline unfamiliar words, translate them manually, and write them down in a notebook. LexiLearn eliminates this tedious process by allowing users to upload a PDF book or a video, where an AI-powered model extracts text, identifies unique words, and generates flashcards with translations.
Users can then study these flashcards daily using the spaced repetition method, similar to Anki, ensuring effective long-term memorization. This way, by mastering the vocabulary of a book, users can read fluently without constant dictionary lookups.
Additionally,  supports video uploads, where AI transcribes the speech and extracts key vocabulary, making it an all-in-one solution for immersive language learning.
